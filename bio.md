Sean Chester is a postdoctoral fellow in the 
[Data and Information Management](https://www.ntnu.edu/idi/groups/dif) group 
at Norway's top university for sciences and home institution of 
[four Nobel Prize Laureates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_University_of_Science_and_Technology#Nobel_Laureates): 
NTNU. 
His research focuses on designing algorithms for managing and querying data on 
modern, highly parallel architectures such as graphics processing cards (GPUs) and 
multi-socket (i.e., NUMA) CPUs. 
This _basic research_, which typically results in 
papers at top conferences such as **PVLDB**, **ICDE**, and **AAAI** and 
academic-ready software on 
[GitHub](http://github.com/sean-chester), enables other researchers to conduct experiments 
in minutes or hours when they would otherwise take days or weeks. 
He works closely with researchers at Aarhus University in Denmark, 
EPFL in Switzerland, 
Sheffield University in England, 
and the University of Victoria in Canada.

The [University of Victoria](http://csc.uvic.ca) is where Dr. Chester obtained his 
PhD in 2013 under the co-supervision of 
[Alex Thomo](http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~thomo/), 
[Venkatesh Srinivasan](http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~venkat/), 
and [Sue Whitesides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Whitesides). 
It is also where he competed on the varsity athletics team for two years 
and was selected for the national collegiate championships in cross-country. 
From September 2013 until October 2015, he was a postdoctoral researcher 
in the [Data-Intensive Systems](http://cs.au.dk/research-at-cs/data-intensive-systems/) 
group of [Ira Assent](http://www.cs.au.dk/~ira/) at Aarhus University.
