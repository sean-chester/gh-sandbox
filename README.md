_*Warning! Here be dragons!!*_

_Interacting with this repository, either as source or on the visible github pages deployment, could turn your computer into a fire-breathing serpent who eats Computer Scientists. It may have other unanticipated effects. You proceed at your own risk._

**Ignore the warning and view the website in the wild**: https://sean-chester.github.io/gh-sandbox/.

This repository is simply for trialling out new ideas, many of which should never have occurred in the first place. The repository could also disappear, reappear, and generally act like an intermittently transparent ghost without any warning at all. You really ought to be spooked.
